          <h1>A bit about me</h1>
            <p> I am Tewodros Woldegebriel, a proffessional in Cyber security.
              I live in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.I have started my professional career in 
              Information Technology as an IT Support staff and then worked as IT Expert, 
              a Network Administrator, and as a Senior IT Security Officer in different 
              governmental organizations in Ethiopia for the past 10 years. I am fast learner 
              and sociable individual where I can adapt to new work environment quickly, apply 
              my education, communicate with coworkers professionally and perform very well.

              and endpoint security. I am dedicated to staying ahead of the curve by continuously 
              enhancing my skills through certifications and hands-on experience with the latest 
              security technologies. When I'm not working, I enjoy watching movies, listening 
              songs and reading inspirational books which helps me stay balanced and focused. <br>
